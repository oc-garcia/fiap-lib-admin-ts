# FIAP TypeScript Challenge

## Objective

Develop a library management system using the latest version of TypeScript. The focus will be on creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that connects to a database, which can be NoSQL or SQL.

## Functional Requirements

Book Management: The goal of your system will be to provide an API that has CRUD functionalities so that a Front-end application can manage this data.

Proposed Structure for Book Entity: Each book can have a title, author, ISBN, year of publication, and if you want to venture out, you can add a Publisher Entity, so a book can be part of a Publisher and a Publisher can have a list of books.

## Technical Requirements

Development of the project using the latest version of TypeScript to ensure that your code is up to date.

Integration of the system with a database that can be NoSQL or SQL. In this scenario, you can use Docker or a free database like PostgreSQL on the Supabase platform.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:
